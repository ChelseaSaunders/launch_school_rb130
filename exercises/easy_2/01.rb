# The Range#step method lets you iterate over a range of values where each value
# in the iteration is the previous value plus a "step" value. It returns the
# original range.

# Write a method that does the same thing as Range#step, but does not operate on
# a range. Instead, your method should take 3 arguments: the starting value,
# the ending value, and the step value to be applied to each iteration. Your
# method should also take a block to which it will yield (or call) successive
# iteration values.

def step(initial, final, step)
  num = initial

  loop do
    yield num
    num += step
    break if num > final
  end

  final
end

step(1, 10, 3) { |value| puts "value = #{value}" }

# value = 1
# value = 4
# value = 7
# value = 10
